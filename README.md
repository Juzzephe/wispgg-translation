Javascript Translation for Wisp.gg Panel

As of now there is no language support for WISP.GG. 
As we only host in german language, it looks a bit odd having the panel in english only. I created i hack where you can replace text via injecting javascript. 
Its not the best solution as the javascript is beeing loaded when rendering is finished (sometimes you will still see english text for a few milliseconds) but its better than nothing. I might completly rework this javascript sometime. 

Feel free to contribute.
